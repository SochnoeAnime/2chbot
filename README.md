# 2chbot
A simple bot that analyzes threads from 2ch.hk/b/ and sends a webhook to discord about the presence of wemb and fap threads. 
While doing this project, I learned to classify information.
Initially, the bot did not use a trained model, but used a regular keyword filter (maybe I will post this version as well), but I decided to try a little machine learning.
Hopefully this project will be a good start to my portfolio.

To use, install all missing libraries and paste WEBHOOK_ID and WEBHOOK_TOKEN into hook.py
Selenium uses Google Chrome and chromedriver.
